# Details #
MnemonicFS is a methodology or even a storage paradigm for storing files such that you can literally have several millions of documents accrued across a span of several years in your document corpus, and you can later precisely retrieve the document or set of documents from this document corpus, based on certain mnemonic principles that you can apply to the documents while storing them.
